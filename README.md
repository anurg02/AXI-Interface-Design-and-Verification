# AXI-Interface-Design-and-Verification
This is an implementation of an example of AXI-Stream interface and an AXI-lite interface RTL design and Functional verification using SystemVerilog bsed Constrained Random Verification. 
## AXI-Stream interface 
This is an implementation of an AXI-Stream slave where I have implemented a simple AXI-handshake.
## AXI-Lite interface 
AXI-Lite interface design contains a full AXI-lite top module, in which I have instantiated AXIL-Master, AXIL-Slave and an interface to connect the design to the testbench stimuli.
